# GoogleMapsRoutePlanner

This was originally part of a 3rd year group project which involved creating a playground finder web application. This was created purely to show off the functionality, the finished application can be viewed at http://playground.betterfrog.com/.
My part in this assignment involved devloping the route functionality which allowed users to select from a list of playgrounds and calculate the best route.
This was developed using the Google Maps Api, along with HTML, CSS and Javascript and allowed users to select from a list of walking,cycling,driving or public transport.
The directions are then displayed in a list below the search section.



Overall result - 75%
